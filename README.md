You can change the path for what you will copy (sourceFolder) to the destination path (destinationFolder) at the buttom at the script. 

sourceFolder = "/Users/moa/Documents/backup1"
destinationFolder = "/Users/moa/Documents/backup2"

Then you can click on the green play buttom that says "run main" at the top right corner.
